        <span>It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters</span>
        <span>And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.</span>
        <span>It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight</span>
        <span>To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="odd">
        <span>Yeah,</span>
        <span>We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time</span>
        <span>It's miserable and magical.</span>
        <span>Oh, yeah</span>
        <span>Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines</span>
        <span>It's time</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        <span>Uh oh!</span>
        <span>I don't know about you</span>
        <span>But I'm feeling 22</span>
        <span>Everything will be alright</span>
        <span>If you keep me next to you</span>
        <span>You don't know about me</span>
        <span>But I'll bet you want to</span>
        <span>Everything will be alright</span>
        <span>If we just keep dancing like we're</span>
        <span>22, ooh-ooh</span>
        <span>22, ooh-ooh</span>
    </p>

    <p class="odd">
        <span>It seems like one of those nights,</span>
        <span>This place is too crowded.</span>
        <span>Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)</span>
        <span>It seems like one of those nights,</span>
        <span>We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming Instead of sleeping.</span>
